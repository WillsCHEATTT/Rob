<!-- ABOUT ROB -->
## About Rob <a name="about-rob"></a>
The uncreative name Rob comes from my middle name Robert. Rob is the nickname to my current laptop, to be more specific my laptop configs. Here in this repo lies all the configs for my computer. Everything from .bashrc, .zshrc, .vimrc, i3config you name it! You may be wondering why I refer to bert as another thing... Well because it is. Rob is my current HP Laptop, Bert will be the name of my next laptop *granted this will not happen anytime soon, Rob works just fine*! Rob will stay around for a long time though, I plan on keeping this repo alive and updated. If you like Rob support him by staring this repo! Every star cheers up little Rob's motherboard!

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>
So, you want to install Rob, well I don't blame you rob is a pretty cool looking dude! There are two ways to install Rob, one way is using **QCBuilder**. QCBuilder will install and setup Rob on your ubuntu 20.04LTS install! Another way would be the manual way, the manual way is the best way to install Rob on operating systems other then ubuntu. Don't worry even the manual install is easy and you will be walked step by step!

#### Manual Installation <a name="manual-installation"></a>
Installing Rob can be easy with the use of QCBuilder. Only thing is QCBuilder only works on ubuntu 20.04 LTS :(. Do not fret! Rob does support all other systems that also support i3WM! With that in mind lets hop into the manual install.

##### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

##### Fonts
Rob requires a few fonts to make it look the way it does. These fonts can be found in [/fonts/](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/Rob/tree/main/fonts), you can download and install them manualy or use [FontManager](https://github.com/FontManager/font-manager) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) to install them.

###### Fontmanager and Git
```sh
echo "Hello"
```
